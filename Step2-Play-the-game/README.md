# Step 2 - Playing the game

In this step we will write the code for selecting which shape you want to play out of Rock, Paper or Scissors, and for the computer to select one of these shapes at random. We will then show the two shapes together and try and work out who won.

### Make lists

This project will use Python *lists* in several places. The first two lists we need are for the image files which *you* and the *computer* will use in the game. Make a list for the computer's image files like this:
```
computer_hands = ["computer_rock.gif", "computer_paper.gif", "computer_scissors.gif"]
```

Then add a line to make a similar list for the shapes for *your* hand. Watch out! The order of the shapes is important, so make sure you have the Rock, Paper and Scissors images in that order.

### Make your choice

In the text-only version of the game you make a choice of Rock, Paper or Scissors using the Python ```input()``` statement. For the turtle version this would mean having to switch to the Python shell window to make the choice, then switch back to the turtle window to play the game. For the turtle version we can use the turtle function ```screen.textinput()```.

### Have the computer make a choice

### Show the choices

### Who won?
