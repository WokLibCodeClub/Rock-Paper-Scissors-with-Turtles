# Step 5 - Keeping the score - Part 2

If you play the game many times it would be nice to keep a score to see if you have won more often than the computer. There are two parts to this. Obviously we need to write code to keep track of the two scores, and more code to display the scores on the screen but before that we have to find a way for Python to work out who has won each game.

### Keeping track of the score


### Displaying the score


Many games can be controlled simply by using the mouse, without needing to go to the keyboard at all. We can make a few changes to the code so far so that the player can choose Rock, Paper or Scissors (and whether to play again), simply by clicking on parts of the screen. That is in the next step.
