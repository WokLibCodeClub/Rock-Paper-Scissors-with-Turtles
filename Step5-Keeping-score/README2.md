# Step 5 - Keeping the score - Part 2

We've now written code so Python knows who won each game. The next steps are to use this information to keep track of Your score, and the Computer's score, and display these scores on the screen.

### Keeping track of the score

If you've ever written a Scratch programme which has a score you will know that the way to keep track of a score is to put the score in a *variable*. We need two variables - one for your score and one for the computer's.

Near the top of the code, before the function definitions, **add two lines** which will set these two variables to zero.

### Displaying the score


In this version of the game we use the keyboard to select our hand shape and say whether we want to play again, but many games can be controlled simply by using the mouse, without needing to go to the keyboard at all. We can make a few changes to the code so far so that you can choose Rock, Paper or Scissors (and whether to play again), simply by clicking on parts of the screen. That is in the next step.
