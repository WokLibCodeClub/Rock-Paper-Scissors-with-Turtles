# Rock, Paper, Scissors with Turtles

This project is based on the Python project Rock, Paper, Scissors developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation at 

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors.

Their version introduces Python ```if``` statements but it is completely text based, so it is not very exciting to watch.

This version uses Turtle graphics to show the hand shapes for the game, and also displays a score for You vs Computer.

Unfortunately this project will not work with trinket, as trinket does not recognise some of the turtle commands. You can write the code using the IDLE editor or Visual Studio Basic and the code works in both these editors.

In the first section you make your selections by typing text, using the Turtle ```write.textinput()``` function, while the second section introduces ```onclick()``` events so the game is completely mouse controlled.

Let's get started!
