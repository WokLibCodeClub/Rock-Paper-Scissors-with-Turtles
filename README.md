# Rock, Paper, Scissors with Turtles

This project is based on the Python project Rock, Paper, Scissors developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation at

[projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors).

Their version is completely text based - you type in your choice of rock, paper or scissors and the computer types out who has won - so it is not very exciting to watch.

Our version uses Turtle graphics to show the hand shapes for rock, paper and scissors, and also keeps score for You vs Computer, in case you want to play many times.

## Coding online using trinket

These instructions have been written for you to build the project in an online account at [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) (as was the original Code Club Raspberry Pi project). If you do not have a trinket account you can go to their website and follow the link to [Sign Up](https://trinket.io/signup).

You will need to log on to your trinket account before proceeding, then click on the link below to open the starter project:

[https://trinket.io/python/436b3dca41](https://trinket.io/python/436b3dca41)

Click on the Remix button to make a copy of this code in your own account. You should then go to the web page for *My Trinkets* by clicking the little arrow next to your username and selecting My Trinkets. Look in your trinkets for the project called **Rock-Paper-Scissors-starter Remix** and click on it to open the editor page. You can now rename the project if you wish, and save it.

## Coding using a standalone Python installation

You can, of course, build up this project using a standalone Python installation and an editor on your own computer, without having to use an online editor like trinket. However, to do this, you will need to download some resources from this website.

Find the resources you need and the instructions for downloading them by going [here](Resources-if-not-using-trinket).
