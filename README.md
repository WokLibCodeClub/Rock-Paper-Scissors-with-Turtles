# Rock, Paper, Scissors with Turtles

This project is based on the Python project Rock, Paper, Scissors developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation at

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors.

Their version is completely text based - you type in your choice of rock, paper or scissors and the computer types out who has won - so it is not very exciting to watch.

Our version uses Turtle graphics to show the hand shapes for rock, paper and scissors, and also keeps score for You vs Computer, in case you want to play many times.

There are **two sets of instructions** for this project, depending on whether you are using a local Python installation on your computer or coding online using trinket.io. This is because certain of the turtle instructions which work with a local Python installation do not work in trinket.

## Option 1 - using a local Python installation

You can write the code using the IDLE editor,  Visual Studio Basic or any other preferred Python editor.

In the first part of the project you make your selection of rock, paper or scissors by typing text into a text box, using the Turtle ```write.textinput()``` function. The second part of the project introduces turtle ```onclick()``` events so you can make your selection by clicking with the mouse.

Let's get started!

## Option 2 - coding online using trinket

You will need to log on to your trinket account and open the starter project:

[https://trinket.io/python/436b3dca41](https://trinket.io/python/436b3dca41)

Click on the Remix button to make a copy of this code in your own account. You should then go to the web page for *My Trinkets* by clicking the little arrow next to your username and selecting My Trinkets. Look in your trinkets for the project called **Rock-Paper-Scissors-starter Remix** and click on it to open the editor page. You can now rename the project if you wish, and save it.
