### Have the computer make a choice

We don't need to ask the computer what shape to choose - we will use a random number for this. We will put the computer choice in a variable called ```computer_choice``` and select the value using the ```randint()``` function.

Add this as the first line of the function and *indent it* because it is inside the function. This line will take a whole number from 0 to 2 at random and put the value in the variable ```computer_choice```:
```
    computer_choice = randint(0, 2)
```
