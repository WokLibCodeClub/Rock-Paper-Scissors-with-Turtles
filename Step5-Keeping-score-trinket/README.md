# Step 5 - Keeping the score - Part 1 - trinket

When you play the game many times it would be nice to keep a score, to see who is ahead - you or the computer. The first problem in keeping score is to work out who won the game.

When you look at the two hand shapes for You and Computer you can work out in an instant who has won, but all Python knows is which hand shapes were chosen - it can't tell who was the winner unless you code in the rules of the game. This shows you are more intelligent than a computer!

So there are two parts to writing code to keep score. Obviously we need code to keep track of the two scores, and more code to display the scores on the screen, but before that we have to find a way for Python to work out who has won each game. This page, part 1 of step 4, will cover working out who won, while the next page, part 2 of step 4, will cover the variables for keeping score, and coding a new turtle to display them.

## Working out who won

Remember, from Steps 2 and 3, that for the game we set two variables for you and the computer, called  ```player_choice``` and ```computer_choice```, to store which of rock, paper and scissors the two players had chosen. We used a special code for these two variables: they were set to 0 for *rock*; 1 for *paper* and 2 for *scissors*.

We will put the code for working out the winner inside the function ```play_game()```, just after we have *shown* the two turtles ```player``` and ```computer```. Find this place in your code now. A very good tip would be to put a comment into your code here, like this:

```python
  # work out who won
```

to remind us what the next bit of code will do.

### The long tedious way

Let's say you chose *Rock* (so the variable ```player_choice``` is set to 0) and the computer randomly chose *Scissors* (```computer_choice``` is set to 2). This means You won. We can write this in code using a Python ```if``` block (this code will be inside the function ```play_game()``` so the ```if``` line needs to be indented):

```python
  if player_choice == 0 and computer_choice == 2:
    print('You won!')
```

That deals with who won for one single outcome of the game; unfortunately there are *nine* different possible outcomes of the game (see if you can list them all) and you will have to write a similar ```if``` block with different values and work out who won, or if it was a draw, for *each outcome*.

What a drag!

### The short smart way

There is a much smarter way of coding all possible results using just three lines of code!

If you added the two lines above to your code then you should **delete** these.

Let's look at all the possibilities where ***you beat the computer***:

```python
  your                      computer's                         player_choice minus
 choice   player_choice =       choice     computer_choice =     computer_choice
--------  ---------------   -----------    -----------------    -----------------
 Paper           1              Rock               0                 1-0 = 1
Scissors         2             Paper               1                 2-1 = 1
  Rock           0            Scissors             2                 0-2 = -2
```

You can see that when you win, the value of the ```player_choice``` variable is usually bigger than the value of the ```computer_choice``` variable, except for the annoying case where you chose *rock* and the computer chose *scissors*.  One way for Python to tell which of two numbers is bigger is to subtract one from the other: if the answer is positive then the first number is bigger, and if the answer is negative then the second number is bigger. In the last column you can see the answers if you subtract the ```computer_choice``` variable from the ```player_choice``` variable. The answer is always 1, except for the last line, where the answer is -2.

Luckily Python has a clever arithmetic trick which we can use here. When you first learned division you were probably taught to give the answers using a remainder - for example ```7 รท 4 = 1, remainder 3```. Now that you know about fractions and decimals you probably never use the remainder method, but in computer coding the remainders are so useful that Python has a special operator for calculating them. Here is the Python code to calculate the remainder after dividing 7 by 4. It uses a percentage sign instead of the normal slash sign for division:

```python
7 % 4
```

If you type this line into a Python console (open [Your Interactive Python Console](https://trinket.io/console)) and press return it will show:

```python
3
```

Try it again, varying the numbers.

This is called *modulo division* or *remainder division*.

It turns out that if we do modulo division by 3 for the numbers 1 and -2, both give the same answer, which is 1:

```python
 1 % 3 = 1
-2 % 3 = 1
```

So if you calculate the subtraction sum ```player_choice - computer_choice``` and do modulo division by 3, if you win the game **it always gives the answer 1**.

#### Results table for You beating the Computer

```python
  your                      computer's                         player_choice minus    modulo division
 choice   player_choice =       choice     computer_choice =     computer_choice           by 3
--------  ---------------   -----------    -----------------    -----------------     ---------------
 Paper           1              Rock               0                 1-0 = 1            (1-0)%3 = 1
Scissors         2             Paper               1                 2-1 = 1            (2-1)%3 = 1
  Rock           0            Scissors             2                 0-2 = -2           (0-2)%3 = 1
```

We could make another similar table but this time for all the cases where *the computer beats you*. You would find that if you calculate the subtraction sum ```player_choice - computer_choice``` and do modulo division by 3, if the computer wins the game **it always gives the answer 2**.

And if you and the computer choose the same hand shape, then ```player_choice - computer_choice``` gives 0, and modulo division by 3 also gives 0.

So, by doing this bit of maths we can say:

- ```(player_choice - computer_choice)%3 = 0``` means ***it was a draw***
- ```(player_choice - computer_choice)%3 = 1``` means ***You won***
- ```(player_choice - computer_choice)%3 = 2``` means ***Computer won***

### Write code for finding who won

Using remainder division here's how to work out what the result of the game was, using only three lines of code:

1. make another list, and put it after the lists of image files, near the beginning of your code:

```python
outcomes = ["It was a draw", "You won", "You lost"]
```

These are the three possible *outcomes*, one of which we will print at the end of each game. You could change the text if you wanted, maybe including smiley face and sad face emojis.

2. Inside the function ```play_game```, after the code which shows the two turtles, add this (properly indented):

```python
    result = (player_choice - computer_choice) % 3
```

This code first calculates the subtraction sum ```computer_choice - player_choice```, then finds the remainder after dividing by three (the brackets are there to ensure Python does the subtraction first). The answer to this sum will be 0 if it was a draw; 1 if you won; 2 if the computer won, and we put this number in a new variable ```result```.

We can use the variable ```result``` choose which text to print for the result of the game by using as an *index* for our list of outcomes: if ```result``` = 0 (for a draw) it will print item [0] of the list; if ```result``` = 1 (for you winning) it will print item [1] of the list; if ```result``` = 2 (for computer winning) it will print item [2] of the list.

Add another line of code after the last to do this:

  print(results[result])

Just three lines of code to cover all the possible combinations.

Save and Run your code. You should find Python will now print out the result  of each game in the text window. Check it's always giving the right answer!

Actually, we don't want to print the result in the text window; we actually want to write the result on the screen using a turtle. In the Part 2 we will see how to do this.
