# Step 3 - Adding some background and building up the tension...

What if you forget which hand is yours and which is the computer's? We need to add a bit of annotation to the window to keep things straight.

In our game so far the two turtle hands appear as soon as you've made your choice. It would be a bit more exciting if we had a short delay, to build up the tension. Maybe we could have a countdown - 3, 2, 1 - appear on the screen before showing the turtle hands.

We will make two new turtles, one to draw some background information, and another to show us a countdown.
