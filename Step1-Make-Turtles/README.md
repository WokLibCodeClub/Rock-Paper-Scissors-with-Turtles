# Rock, Paper, Scissors with Turtles
This project is based on the Python project Rock, Paper, Scissors developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-paper-scissors

Their version introduces Python ```if``` statements but it is completely text based, so it is not very exciting to watch.

This version uses Turtle graphics to show the hand shapes for the game, and also display a score for You vs Computer.

In the first section you make your selections by typing text, using the Turtle ```write.textinput()``` function, while the second section introduces ```onclick()``` events so the game is completely mouse controlled.

Let's get started!
