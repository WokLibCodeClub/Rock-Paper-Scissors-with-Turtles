# Making smarter code

You just made two turtles, and for each turtle you typed in the same code - to **hide** the turtle, set it to **penup** and set its speed to **speed(0)**.

Later in the game you will be making up to eight more turtles, and for each one you will want the same three instructions - that's a lot of typing, especially as almost all the typing can be avoided by using a smart Python *repeat loop*.

## Using a Python ```for``` loop



Now we can get going with coding the game.
